# newVideoDownloader.py
I used to download YouTube videos with YouTube Premium to watch them offline, however, I am no longer, 
after many years, a YouTube Premium member.  So, I decided to write a little Python program that checks 
some of my favourite YouTubers' channels for new videos, and when a new video is posted, it is then 
downloaded in the highest quality to be viewed!  I still have a long ways to go, as I've just started
this project, and it is my first project to ever incorporate an API.  Enjoy, I'll update as I go!

If, for any reason, you would like to donate- though unneccesary, is always apreciated!
